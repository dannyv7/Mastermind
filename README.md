Setting showCode to true at the bottom of the main in Mastermind.java will display the secret code for testing purposes. 

Wasn't sure of what format the UML was supposed to be in. I submitted both a .uml and .pdf just in case. - Joel 

UML Diagrams are inside the assignment2 folder with the rest of the Java code -Danny
Please make sure to leave the txt file with the rest of our .java files - we need it for the intro text
The github sync seems to be a little off as every recent commit is shown as Joel's commit even when we are both commiting
